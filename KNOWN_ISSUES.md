# Known Issues & Future Improvements

## Launch Blockers (none)
All items below are post-launch improvements.

## Tracking

- [ ] **No `<meta>` description or OG tags** — Search engines and social media shares have nothing to show. Add `<meta name="description">` and Open Graph tags for link previews.

- [ ] **No favicon** — Browsers show a blank tab icon. Add a `favicon.ico` or `<link rel="icon">` using the existing SVG logo.

- [ ] **Stats may feel fabricated** — "2,847 processes automated", "14,200+ hours saved/month", "892 active workflows", "50+ clients served" — if this is a new company (Est. 2026), these numbers may undermine credibility. Consider using aspirational language or removing specific numbers until real data exists.

- [ ] **No mobile hamburger menu** — Nav links `display: none` on mobile with no alternative. Mobile users can only navigate by scrolling. Add a hamburger menu for mobile breakpoints.

- [ ] **No form or booking widget** — CTAs reference assessment/booking but there's no form. Consider embedding Calendly or a simple contact form in the future.

- [ ] **No social media links** — LinkedIn, X/Twitter links were removed because they were dead. Add them back once real profiles exist.

- [ ] **Footer is minimal** — Placeholder columns (Case Studies, Careers, Privacy, Terms) were removed. Add them back as content becomes available.
